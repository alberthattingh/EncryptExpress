# EncryptExpress
Project for encrypting and decrypting simple text-strings and files.

## Installation
I honestly have no idea at the moment... This repo isn't really meant for other people though, it's actually just my semester project for Information Security. If you're interested in it you'll eventually figure out how to install it anyway - you could probably just clone it and use it.

## Usage
To be addressed in the future.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. Maybe you'll have a good idea that could get me an A for this project! It would probably be a good idea though to just open a new issue to propose your idea to me - then I would actually be doing my own project by myself.
